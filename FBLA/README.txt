
Hello! I see you have questions regarding the Program.py file or the FBLA application.


Most of the details of how the code works is in the py file which I will put with the application.



*NOTE: IF YOU OPENED THIS README ON THE PROGRAM THEN THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN UNTIL YOU CLOSE THIS WINDOW


HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION

--------------------------
This is for you, if you're planning on running this program. 

In order to run the application, make sure you have at least Python 3.7 installed onto your computer.

Use a code editor such as Wing Personal (in credits) or visual studio.

Be sure to install pip https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

install Pyqt5 using pip https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/


1. install MySQL, preferably 5.7.X. Two important modules to install would be the mysql.connector (5.7.X) and MySQL workbench 8.0.X. Make sure you also have the 5.7 MySQL command line. (I recommend that you surf the web for the mysql.connector: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
*X could be whatever version you perfer

2. Create and run a server via localhost

3. Create a database with the name "username".

4. Go to MySQL command line and import the user tables via command line. 
	mysql> use db_username;
	mysql> source /PATH TO FILE/username_log.sql;
	mysql> source /PATH TO FILE/username_users.sql;
*/PATH TO FILE/ is the exact path that the database must use in order to import data. It is recommended that the files should be moved to C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.7/bin/

5. Open the program file with a code editior program and adjust the "db = mysql.connect()" code written between lines 12-16. 
	-Change "host" to your server host id
	-Change user to root (or your user's username)
	-Change pass to root (or your user's password)
	-If needed, change database to your chosen database name.

6. If the program is a script, you can use the command prompt to do python [program name].py in its respective directory. You could also just click on the application if you have all the modules installed

*All required files and modules should be in the program files.


HOW TO USE APPLICATION

-----------------------

Before you login, you have to register first. You must click on the register button to make your account. Unfortunately, here is no account recovery option, so it is recommended

that you write down the credentials somewhere safe.





NAVIGATION PAGE

--------------

Log Hours: Proceeds to log page



Edit Student: Provides the option to edit the selected student's information (Grade and Name). You cannot change a student's Id.



Remove Student: Removes student and their logs.



View Report: Prints a report of your volunteer hours. It will tell you what category your district is in so far as listed on the page itself.



Change Password: Changes password. WARNING BE CAREFUL WITH USING THIS OR ELSE YOU MAY GET LOCKED OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT. PLEASE WRITE DOWN ANY PASSWORD YOU CHANGE.



Log out: Logs out





HOW TO ADD STUDENT:

------

The edit lines below will provide you the ability to enter student credentials. Click on the "Add Student" button to add the student to your chapter.



*Note: Students cannot have the same existing ID or Name in your chapter.





LOG PAGE

-----

Add Hours: Simply fill the existing form on the top and press the "Add Hours" button. If there is already an existing log with the same Date and Location, it will add to the log.



Delete Hours: Select a row on the table-The numbers beside each row-and click on the "Delete Hours" button to remove the log.



View Info: Select a row on the table-The numbers beside each row-and click on the "Log Details" button to view more information of the log



Hours only/Hours:Mins: Changes the format of the number of hours viewed on the table. This is for preference of the user.



Exit: Exit



*All the data is automatically saved so you don't need to worry about having to update or clicking the X button on the window by accident.







APPLICATION NOTES

--------------------------

Most of the problems I had debugging the project was solved by the controller class.



cursor.execute will execute a command for Mysql. Here are all the commands http://g2pc1.bu.edu/~qzpeng/manual/MySQL%20Commands.htm



If a program crashes or doesn't respond, its best be that you restart the application.



In order to use the ui files, I installed pyuic5 and converted them into py files, then copied and pasted it into the Program file.
*You can find the tools I used to make the ui in the ui folder.



#there was a really weird glitch/error where the data for a student was removed but the student would still be on the combo box, so I simply made some sort of error handler that closes the page and reopens it.



PLEASE SAVE YOUR REGISTER CREDENTIALS SOMEWHERE SAFE





Q&A

------------------------

Q: If a student leaves my chapter because he graduated how do I differentiate from them?



A: For any student that leaves your chapter, you can simply change their names by going to Edit Student and adding (Deactivated) onto their names. An Example would be 

Yoshikage Kira had about 10 hours of volunteer work and he graduated. Simply change his name from Yoshikage Kira to Yoshikage Kira (Deactivated).



Q: Is there a way to change the Student ID?



A: Unfourntaly not, the Student ID is very vital to a student's identification.



Q: How do you prevent your credentials from being lost?



A: Write them down into a notebook, I did not spend money on internet security okay?



Q: What kind of database did you use?



A: Good question, read below.





DATABASES

-------------

All data is stored in a local mysql server on my computer. The passwords are encoded with a pass code.



How I worked with the database on this project was with using relational tables. I used two tables one for username storage and another for volunteer hour storage.



When the user logs in, their user_id table "log" (Volunteer hours storage) is their respective auto incremented Id on the username storage. I use this user_id in junction with the 

student name to pull the stored volunteer hours that the students have done.
